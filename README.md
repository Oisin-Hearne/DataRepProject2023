# Teambuilder

This simple React App allows you to create and store teams of Pokémon, see the created teams, and see a list of Pokémon fetched from PokeAPI.

This doesn't use any packages that we haven't used in the labs as far as I know, but I've used some Bootstrap components that I thought looked nice (Table, Form).
